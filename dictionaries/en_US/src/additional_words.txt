# The CSpell English dictionary uses the SCOWL (Spell Checker Oriented Word Lists) dictionary as a
# base: http://wordlist.aspell.net/

# Additionally, CSpell adds some extra words to that dictionary that are very common. (These
# additional words should probably be included in the SCOWL dictionary, but they are not included
# for whatever reason.) This file contains those extra words.

# When adding words to the CSpell English dictionary via a pull request, please add the words to
# this file, so that the "extra" words can be delineated from the official SCOWL words.
