# The CSpell English dictionary uses the SCOWL (Spell Checker Oriented Word Lists) dictionary as a
# base: http://wordlist.aspell.net/
#
# Additionally, CSpell adds some extra words to that dictionary that are very common.
#
# There should be one entry per line.
# Consider adding words to ./shared-additional-words.txt if they are used by all flavors of English.
