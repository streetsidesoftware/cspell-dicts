# The CSpell English dictionary uses the SCOWL (Spell Checker Oriented Word Lists) dictionary as a
# base: http://wordlist.aspell.net/

# Additionally, CSpell adds some extra words to that dictionary that are very common.
# This file contains those extra words.

# When adding words to the CSpell English dictionary via a pull request.

# Until the spell checker supports multi-word terms, the following `cspell-tools` directive is used to
# ensure all parts of multi-word terms are added to the dictionary.
# cspell-tools: split

# There should be one entry per line.
