  Abstract                 = {In recognition domains, publicly available ground-truthed datasets are essential to perform effective performance evaluation and comparison of existing methods and systems. However, in the field of online handwritten mathematical expression recognition, datasets are quite scarce and their creation is one of the current challenging issues. In this paper, we present Express Match, a system designed to help creation and management of online mathematical expression datasets with ground-truth data. In this system, handwritten model expressions can be input and manually annotated with ground-truth data, transcriptions of these expressions can be automatically annotated by matching them to the respective models. Additional metadata can also be attached to each sample expression. To test the system, a dataset consisting of 56 model expressions and 910 sample expressions with a total of 20,010 symbols, written by 25 different writers, has been created. This dataset, as well as Express Match, will be made publicly available.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Despite the recent advances in handwriting recognition, handwritten two-dimensional (2D) languages are still a challenge. Electrical schemas, chemical equations and mathematical expressions (MEs) are examples of such 2D languages. In this case, the recognition problem is particularly difficult due to the two dimensional layout of the language. This paper presents an online handwritten mathematical expression recognition system that handles mathematical expression recognition as a simultaneous optimization of expression segmentation, symbol recognition, and 2D structure recognition under the restriction of a mathematical expression grammar. The originality of the approach is a global strategy allowing learning mathematical symbols and spatial relations directly from complete expressions. A new contextual modeling is proposed for combining syntactic and structural information. Those models are used to find the most likely combination of segmentation/recognition hypotheses proposed by a 2D segmentation scheme. Thus, models are based on structural information concerning the symbol layout. The system is tested with a new public database of mathematical expressions which was used in the \{CHROME\} competition. We have also produced a large base of semi-synthetic expressions which are used to train and test the global learning approach. We obtain very promising results on both synthetic and real expressions databases, as well as in the recent \{CHROME\} competition. },

The use of syntactic methods is useful for interpreting such complex patterns. In this paper we propose a system for the interpretation of 2-D mathematic formulas based on a syntactic parser. This system is able to recognize a large class of 2-D mathematic formulas written on a graphic tablet. It starts the parsing by localization of the ``principal'' operator in the formula and attempts to partition it into subexpressions which are similarly analyzed by looking for a starting character. The generalized parser used in the system has been developed in our group for continuous speech recognition and picture interpretation.},

  Abstract                 = {Cursive script word recognition is the problem of transforming a word from the iconic form of cursive writing to its symbolic form. Several component processes of a recognition system for isolated offline cursive script words are described. A word image is transformed through a hierarchy of representation levels: points, contours, features, letters, and words. A unique feature representation is generated bottom-up from the image using statistical dependences between letters and features. Ratings for partially formed words are computed using a stack algorithm and a lexicon represented as a trie. Several novel techniques for low- and intermediate-level processing for cursive script are described, including heuristics for reference line finding, letter segmentation based on detecting local minima along the lower contour and areas with low vertical profiles, simultaneous encoding of contours and their topological relationships, extracting features, and finding shape-oriented events. Experiments demonstrating the performance of the system are also described},

  Abstract                 = {The authors describe a method which combines dynamic programming and a neural network recognizer for segmenting and recognizing character strings. The method selects the optimal consistent combination of cuts from a set of candidate cuts generated using heuristics. The optimal segmentation is found by representing the image, the candidate segments, and their scores as a graph in which the shortest path corresponds to the optimal interpretation. The scores are given by neural net outputs for each segment. A significant advantage of the method is that the labor required to segment images manually is eliminated. The system was trained on approximately 7000 unsegmented handwritten zip codes provided by the United States Postal Service. The system has achieved a per-zip-code raw recognition rate of 81% on a 2368 handwritten zip-code test set},

In this paper, we incorporate an error detection and correction mechanism into a parser developed previously by us based on de&quot;nite clause grammar (DCG). The resulting system can handle lexical, syntactic and some semantic errors. The recognition speed for 600 commonly seen expressions is quite acceptable, ranging from 0.73 to 6 s per expression on a modest workstation. In addition, we propose a performance evaluation scheme which can be used to demonstrate the e!ectiveness of both the symbol recognition and structural analysis stages by a single measure. � 2001 Pattern},

The network was trained on a set of 12,000 digits and uppercase letters, from approximately 250 different writers, and tested on 2500 such characters from other writers. Classification accuracy exceeded 96% on the test examples.},

  Abstract                 = {Difficulties in Kanji (Chinese character) recognition stem from its large character set (about 5000 characters) and the large number of strokes (up to about sixty) in each character. The paper describes a preliminary approach to this Kanji recognition problem. In the present method, a handprinted Kanji character is coded into a symbol string using the binary relation between stroke and reference zone. Two symbol string recognition methods are proposed and investigated; the direct matching recognition (DMR) method and the unit structure recognition (USR) method. The \{DMR\} method worked efficiently for characters which have up to five strokes. The \{USR\} method represents Kanji characters with a structural unit combination. This method worked efficiently for multi-stroke characters and greatly reduced dictionary update labor. },

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a combined approach for online handwriting symbols recognition. The basic idea of this approach is to employ a set of left-right HMMs to generate a new feature vector as input, and then use SNN as a classifier to finally identify unknown symbols. The new feature vector consists of global features and several pairs of maximum probabilities with their associated different model labels for an observation pattern. A recogniser based on this method inherits the practical and dynamical modeling abilities from HMM, and robust discriminating ability from SNN for classification tasks. This hybrid technique also reduces the dimensions of feature vectors significantly, complexity, and solves size problem when using only SNN. The experimental results show that this approach outperforms several classifiers reported in recent research, and can achieve recognition rates of 97.41%, 91.81% and 91.63% for digits and upper/lower case characters respectively on the UNIPEN database benchmarks.},

The number of target characters is about 2000, and fairly good recognition scores have been attained. Our scheme uses the number of strokes as the primary parameter. We employ three types of recognition strategy depending on the number of strokes. The general stroke vector sequence method, devised to analyze the shape, can represent both skeleton and local characteristics by a small amount of information; and the restricted dynamic programming method is effective to determine the shape of a stroke. The similarity of two shapes and the complexity of a stroke have been introduced to reduce the dictionary size and the processing time, respectively. },

The method is based on combining the decisions of two multi-layer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network classifiers operating on two different feature types. The first feature set is defined on the pseudo Zernike moments of the image whereas the second feature type is derived from the shadow code of the image using a newly defined projection mask. A MLP network is employed to perform the combination task. The performance is tested on a data base of 15000 samples and the advantage of the combination approach is demonstrated.},

This paper presents a segmentation and reconstruction procedure which segments components of a script into sequences of static strokes, and then reconstructs the script from these sequences. The segmentation is based on the extrema of curvature and inflection points in individual components. The static strokes are derived from the delta log-normal model of handwriting generation and are used in component representation and reconstruction. The performance of the procedure is measured in terms of root-mean-square reconstruction error and data compression rate. },

  Abstract                 = {We present a new approach for parsing two- dimensional input using relational grammars and fuzzy sets. A fast, incremental parsing algorithm is devel- oped, motivated by the two-dimensional structure of written mathematics. The approach reports all identifi- able parses of the input. The parses are represented as a fuzzy set, in which the membership grade of a parse measures the similarity between it and the handwrit- ten input. To identify and report parses efficiently, we adapt and apply existing techniques such as rectangular partitions and shared parse forests, and introduce new ideas such as relational classes and interchangeability. We also present a correction mechanism which allows users to navigate parse results and choose the correct interpretation in case of recognition errors or ambigu- ity. Such corrections are incorporated into subsequent incremental recognition results. Finally, we include two empirical evaluations of our recognizer. One uses a novel user-oriented correction count metric, while the other replicates the CROHME 2011 math recognition con- test. Both evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

This system combines a robust input representation, which preserves the dynamic writing information, with a neural network architecture, a so called Multi-State Time Delay Neural Network (MS-TDNN), which integrates recognition and segmentation in a single framework. Our preprocessing transforms the original coordinate sequence into a (still temporal) sequence of feature vectors, which combine strictly local features, like curvature or writing direction, with a bitmap-like representation of the coordinate 's proximity. The MS-TDNN architecture is well suited for handling temporal sequences as provided by this input representation. Our system is tested both on writer dependent and writer independent tasks with vocabulary sizes ranging from 400 up to 20,000 words.

Using dictionaries of this size requires fast search techniques to achieve reasonable recognition times. In this paper we present a search approach yielding recognition times, which are virtually independent of the dictionary size. This approach combines a tree representation of the dictionary with efficent pruning techniques to reduce the search space without loosing much recognition performance compared to a flat exhaustive search through all words in the dictionary. The tree search with pruning is about 15 times faster than a flat search and allows us to run the NPen++ on-line handwriting recognition system in real-time with dictionary sizes up to 100,000 words.},

Recognition of mathematical expressions has been an attractive problem for the pattern recognition community because of the presence of enormous uncertainties and ambiguities as encountered during parsing of the two-dimensional structure of expressions. The goal of this competition is to bring out a state of the art for the related research. Three labs come together to organize the event and six other research groups participated the competition. The competition defines a standard format for presenting information, provides a training set of 921 expressions and supplies the underlying grammar for understanding the content of the training data. Participants were invited to submit their recognizers which were tested with a new set of 348 expressions. Systems are evaluated based on four different aspects of the recognition problem. However, the final rating of the systems is done based on their correct expression recognition accuracies. The best expression level recognition accuracy (on the test data) shown by the competing systems is 19.83% whereas a baseline system developed by one of the organizing groups reports an accuracy 22.41% on the same data set.},

  Abstract                 = {We report on the third international Competition on Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition (CROHME), in which eight teams from academia and industry took part. For the third CROHME, the training dataset was expanded to over 8000 expressions, and new tools were developed for evaluating performance at the level of strokes as well as expressions and symbols. As an informal measure of progress, the performance of the participating systems on the CROHME 2012 data set is also reported. Data and tools used for the competition will be made publicly available.},

The goal of this paper is to dispel the magic behind this black box. This manuscript focuses on building a solid intuition for how and why principal component analysis works. This manuscript crystallizes this knowledge by deriving from simple intuitions, the mathematics behind PCA. This tutorial does not shy away from explaining the ideas informally, nor does it shy away from the mathematics. The hope is that by addressing both aspects, readers of all levels will be able to gain a better understanding of PCA as well as the when, the how and the why of applying this technique.},

  Abstract                 = {Current equation editing systems rely on either textbased equation description languages or on interactive construction by means of structure templates and menus. These systems are often tedious to use, even for experts, because the user is forced to "parse" the expressions mentally before they are entered. This step is not normally part of the process of writing equations on paper or on a whiteboard. We describe a prototype equation editor that is based on handwriting recognition and automatic equation parsing. It is coupled with a user interface that incorporates a set of simple procedures for correcting errors made by the automatic interpretation. Although some correction by the user is typically necessary before the formula is recognized, we have found that the system is simpler and more natural to use than systems based on specialized languages or template-based interaction.},

In particular, we explore whether the use of Deep Belief Networks (DBN) adds any substantial gain over MLPs on the Aurora2 speech recognition task under mismatched noise conditions. Our findings suggest that DBNs outperform single layer MLPs under the clean condition, but the gains diminish as the noise level is increased. Furthermore, using MFCCs in conjunction with the posteriors from DBNs outperforms merely using single DBNs in low to moderate noise conditions. MFCCs, however, do not help for the high noise settings.},

The key feature is a high flexibility regarding the network topology, choice of activation functions, training criteria, and optimization algorithm, as well as a built-in support for efficient GPU computing. The evaluation of run-time performance and recognition accuracy is performed exemplary with a deep neural network as acoustic model in a hybrid NN/HMM system. The results show that RASR achieves a state-of-the-art performance on a real-world large vocabulary task, while offering a complete pipeline for building and applying large scale speech recognition systems.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe a technique for enhancing a user's ability to manipulate hand-printed symbolic information by automatically improving legibility and simultaneously providing immediate feedback on the system's current structural interpretation of the information. Our initial application is a handwriting-based equation editor. Once the user has written a formula, the individual hand-drawn symbols can be gradually translated and scaled to closely approximate their relative positions and sizes in a corresponding typeset version. These transformations preserve the characteristics, or style, of the original userdrawn symbols. In applying this style-preserving morph, the system improves the legibility of the user-drawn symbols by correcting alignment and scaling, and also reveals the baseline structure of the symbols that has been inferred by system. We performed a preliminary user study that indicates that this new method of feedback is a useful addition to a conventional interpretive interface. We believe this is because the style preserving morph makes it easier to understand the correspondence between the original input and interpreted output than methods that radically change the appearance of the original input. Key words: formula entry, math recognition, mental map, morphing, pen-based computing, user feedback. 1},
