\section{Data and Implementation}
We used $\num{369}$ symbol classes with a total of $\num{166898}$ labeled
recordings. Each class has at least $\num{50}$ labeled recordings, but over
$200$ symbols have more than $\num{200}$ labeled recordings and over $100$
symbols have more than $500$ labeled recordings.
The data was collected by two crowd-sourcing projects (Detexify and
\href{http://write-math.com}{write-math.com}) where users wrote
symbols, were then given a list ordered by an early classification system and
clicked on the symbol they wrote.

The data of Detexify and \href{http://write-math.com}{write-math.com} was
combined, filtered semi-automatically and can be downloaded via
\href{http://write-math.com/data}{write-math.com/data} as a compressed tar
archive of CSV files.

All of the following preprocessing and feature computation algorithms were
implemented and are publicly available as open-source software in the Python
package \texttt{hwrt}.
