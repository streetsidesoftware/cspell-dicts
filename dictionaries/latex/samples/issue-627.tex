% Maths
%	- Detecting commented maths is not possible, as the requirements for escaping do not apply.
% 	- It is extremely important to be careful about handling escaped dollar chars,
% 	  otherwise, large portions of the document could be ignored.
%	  e.g. if a commented dollar is interpreted as the start/end of math mode
%	  e.g. if an escaped dollar is interpreted as the start/end of math mode
% Syntax rules (single or double dollar)
% 	Unescaped pairs of dollar chars (which are not commented) delimit math mode
%	This can span multiple lines
%	This can contain escaped dollar chars
%	This can contain comments (which can contain escaped/unescaped dollar chars)
% 	Pairs of single/double dollar chars should be matched, and should not be nested
% Other syntax is not considered (non-exhaustive list)
