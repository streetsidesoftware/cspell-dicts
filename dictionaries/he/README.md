# CSpell he Dictionary

Dictionary for Hebrew language

This is a pre-built dictionary for use with cspell.

# About the Dictionary

The Hebrew Dictionary has been compiled from the Hunspell Hebrew Dictionary:

> By the Hspell project (http://hspell.ivrix.org.il/).
> Hspell version 1.4 was used.
> Copyright 2004-2017, Nadav Har'El and Dan Kenigsberg
> The dictionary (this file and the corresponding word list)
> is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License

But, due to the complexity of the Hebrew language, a significant portion of the dictionary was not able to be
included in this extension.
