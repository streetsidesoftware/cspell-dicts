# Synchronized copy of [aoo-mozilla-en-dict](https://github.com/marcoagpinto/aoo-mozilla-en-dict)

This copy exists to avoid having changes in aoo-mozilla-en-dict break building dictionaries.

It can happen that a dictionary source "goes away" preventing us from building the dictionary.

This "package" exits as a centralized point for aoo-mozilla-en-dict dictionary dependencies.

We also try to avoid including binary files.
