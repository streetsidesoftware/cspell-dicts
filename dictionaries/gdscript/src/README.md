# Source Directory

All source files used to generate the dictionary should be stored in this directory.

Main word list `gdscript-words/gdscript.txt` is generated from Godot
documentation using a script from
[mnemotic/gdscript-words](https://github.com/mnemotic/gdscript-words) (see
`gdscript-words/README.md`) and should not be modified manually. Instead, any
additional words should be added to `gdscript.txt`.
