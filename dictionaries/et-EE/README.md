# CSpell Estonian Dictionary

This is a CSpell repackaging of the [wordlist](http://www.meso.ee/~jjpp/speller/)
created by Jaak Pruulmann.

The following description has been taken from the webpage of the original author:

## Wordlists

The wordlists are based on work by the Institute of the Estonian Language,
subsequently improved by Jaak Pruulmann who also created the affix file.

## Encoding issues

All dictionaries are encoded in the UTF-8 character-set,
which is absolutely necessary to accommodate the plethora of foreign words
featuring S- and Z-caron that see daily usage in the Estonian language.

Dictionaries to accommodate the ISO-8859-1 legacy encoding still used on
some operating systems are also included for completion, but obviously
won't successfully proofread words that use S and Z with a caron accent.

## Wordlist improvement

Corrections to existing words and suggestions for new words are welcome.
Please send them to the author for inclusion in the next revision.
