Important update on -ise and -ize wordlists
-------------------------------------------

The English wordlists for -ise and -ize will require Proofing Tool GUI be updated to be support this functionality.

Additionally, once Proofing Tool GUI supports it, the default version of the British Dictionary will be set to the -ise form.

Thank you for your support!
