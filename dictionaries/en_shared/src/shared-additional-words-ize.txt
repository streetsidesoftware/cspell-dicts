# This file is intended to include "-ize" spellings common to both American (en_US) and British (en_GB) English
#
# This aims to ensure that these shared "-ize" words are available in the en_US, en_GB, and en_GB-MIT dictionaries
# It avoids imposing "-ize" spellings on other English variants like en_CA, en_AU, or en_GB-ise
