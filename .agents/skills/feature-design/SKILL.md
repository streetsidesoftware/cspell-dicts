name: feature-design
description: 'Designs a cspell-dicts change that has more than one reasonable answer through an interview that writes a design under docs/designs/, or checks a small change for side effects before it is built. Covers which file types or locales enable a dictionary, splitting, merging, or renaming dictionaries or dictionary IDs, switching an upstream source, and tooling changes that change what dictionaries contain. Use when the user wants to design, spec out, or plan such a change before building it, is unsure how an edge case should behave, asks for a design doc or to "figure out the details", or asks to check a change for side effects. Also changes a merged design. Never starts unprompted: suggest it in one line and let the user decide. For a new dictionary that fits docs/guides/new-dictionary.md, use new-dictionary, which runs this interview itself without a design file. Not for word changes, bug fixes, refactors, dependency updates, or fully specified changes.'

# feature-design

Settles a design by interviewing the user one question at a time. The goal is a well-designed feature; the design file
is a by-product. Read `docs/feature-design.md` first: it holds the process, and this skill adds only how to run it.

## Workflow

### 1. Name the feature

Agree on the short kebab-case slug that names the design and the branch, such as `split-software-tools`.

- **Do:** propose a slug, and use it unless the user objects.

### 2. Set up a branch and worktree

Keep the design out of the user's checkout, so it never sits as uncommitted changes there.

- **Check** for an earlier session's work first:

  ```sh
  git worktree list
  git branch --list design/<feature>
  ls docs/designs/
  ```

- **Do:**
  - With neither, create both from an up-to-date `origin/main`, in the main checkout: the first path that
    `git worktree list` prints. This is local and reversible, so no need to ask:

    ```sh
    git fetch origin main
    git worktree add -b design/<feature> .claude/worktrees/design-<feature> origin/main
    ```

  - With the branch but no worktree, attach it: the same command without `-b`.
  - When the user or the environment named a branch for this work, such as in a cloud session, use it and skip the
    worktree. A session's own unrelated branch doesn't count.
  - Open a draft PR once the design's first commit exists, and tell the user. Push later commits to it.

### 3. Get to the why

Know why the feature exists before deciding anything.

- **Do:** look up the facts first: the issue, the code, a reproduction.
- **Do:** propose the why in one or two lines, and let the user correct it. If it still reads like a solution, ask "why
  does that matter?" and redraft.
- **Ask,** one at a time, with `docs/design-questions.md`'s "Why and who" group: why now, who is affected, what success
  looks like, and what's out of scope.

### 4. Sketch

Agree on the shape of the solution before the details.

- **Do:** read `docs/design-principles.md`, `docs/design-questions.md`, `docs/glossary.md`,
  `docs/dictionary-packages.md`, and `docs/repository.md`. Look through `docs/designs/` and closed issues for earlier
  thinking.
- **Ask:** propose the sketch in a few lines, with one example: the cspell config a user writes and what cspell
  reports, or the command a contributor types and what the tool does.
- **Do:** write `docs/designs/<feature>.md` from the guide's skeleton, add its line to `docs/designs/README.md`, and
  commit. When a part can be read on its own, move to a folder as the guide's "Where it lives" says.

### 5. Walk the design questions

Decide one thing at a time, in the groups of `docs/design-questions.md` that apply.

- **Ask** each question this way:
  - One question at a time. Move on only when it's resolved.
  - Lettered options, each showing what the user would write or see: the cspell config, or a line of text and whether
    it's flagged. Put your recommendation first, and say why.
  - Check facts before asking, such as with `pnpm exec cspell trace` or a test build, and bring the result.
  - "You decide" is an answer: propose a default, and record it.
  - The user can defer: note it under Open questions, and come back to it before step 7.
- **Do:**
  - Give a question time when its answer could change the sketch or would be hard to undo. For anything else, propose
    a default in one line.
  - A question with only one reasonable answer, once you look at the code, isn't a decision. Note it and move on.
  - A remark made in passing is often a standing rule. Confirm it, then record it where it applies:
    `docs/design-principles.md` or another doc under `docs/`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, or `CLAUDE.md`.
  - Update the Design section as each point is settled, with the alternatives turned down. Commit when it's useful.

### 6. Stop when the code is the easier answer

Hand the user a clear state, and leave building as a separate step.

- **Do:** tell the user:
  - what was decided, and what was left open.
  - which names are still provisional. Each needs a decision, or an issue saying when it must be decided.
  - where the work lives: the branch, and the worktree's path.
- **Do:** stop at the design. A quick prototype is fine when it answers a question faster. Building is a separate step,
  such as with the `new-dictionary` skill.

### 7. Finish before merge

Turn the working design into what the guide's "Before merge" describes.

- **Stop and ask:** wait until the user says the design is done.
- **Do:** follow the guide's "Before merge". Settle or drop each open question with the user.
- **Check:** start a subagent that is given only the paths of the design, and told not to read the code. Ask it to say
  what was decided, why, and how the decisions fit together, and to list gaps, contradictions, and anything it had to
  guess. If you can't start a subagent, write that request out in full for the user, with the paths and a note that
  the reader has no other context. Ask them to run it in a new session and paste its report back, and wait for it.
- **Stop and ask:** show the user the report, and fix what they agree with.
- **Stop and ask:** does the design get its own `docs:` PR, or go in the PR that builds it? See the guide's "Where it
  lives".
- **Check:** `pnpm run lint` passes. Fix what it finds, and run it again until it does.

### 8. Change a merged design

Keep a merged design true when a decision changes.

- **Do:** follow the guide's "Changing a merged design", on a branch set up as in step 2.

## Check a change

For a small change, when the user asks to check it before or while building. No design file, no interview.

- State the change and its why in a sentence or two, from the conversation, the issue, and the code.
- Check it against `docs/design-questions.md`. List every side effect you find, with what it would change for users.
- Raise anything that could change the approach or is hard to undo. If a hard-to-undo choice with more than one
  reasonable answer turns up, suggest designing it, in one line.

## Not this skill

- The request is really a word change, or a change that's already fully specified. Say so, and stop.
- Designs are for people: they never point to `CLAUDE.md`.
