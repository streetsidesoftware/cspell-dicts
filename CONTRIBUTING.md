## Proposing Words

If you have a word you believe belongs in a dictionary, send a pull request.
For words associated with a particular programming language / environment, they should go in the appropriate dictionary under `dictionaries/<language>/src/<language>.txt`(s).
For general-purpose words, put them in the closest appropriate `dictionaries/<general-area>`(s).
SeeÂ the `README.md` files in those directories for more information.
