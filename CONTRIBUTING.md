- For words associated with a particular programming language / environment, they should go in the appropriate dictionary under `dictionaries/<language>/src/<language>.txt`(s).
- It is okay to add multiple words in one Pull request, as long as they are related _(same dictionary or concept)_
- For general-purpose words, put them in the closest appropriate `dictionaries/<general-area>`(s).
